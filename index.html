    <h2 style = "font-weight: 100; padding-bottom: 20px;">Innovation Survey Three</h2> 
    <h1><font size ='+5'><B>Anonymous</B></font></h1>
    <ol>
    <li><h4 style="padding-top: 50px;">Do you consent to giving your input on this survey?</h4></li>
    <p style="font-family:courier new;">Yes</p>
    
    <li><h4>Do you have an experienced issue with the the NHS? If so, what was it?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Having worked in the nhs for 40 years, I personally don't have any issues </li>
      <li>I don't care if people are nice or not nice to me frankly </li>
      <li>I get paid nothing at all so I don't do what I do for the money. I just like looking after people. The pay is terrible. As someone who works in the private sector as well I make a lot of money there so the pay in the NHS is not relevant. </li>
        
    </ul>

    <li><h4>How do you feel about waiting times at hospitals? </h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
        <li>We (this person's sector that they run) don't have any - a load of shite. We are on target with all our cancer patients</li>
        <li>Fundamentally disagree with ‘an hour culture' - the whole deal is about caring for people </li>
          
      </ul> 

    <li><h4>Are hospital staff overworked? Why/why not?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>They're not. My opinions are not controversial</li>
      <li>If you can't look after yourself and step up to the plate and look after people properly don't become a doctor or a nurse - fuck off</li>
      <li>Do you want to go and be looked after by someone that is looking at the clock? </li>
      <li>We are on target with all our cancer patients</li>
      <li>Do what you need to do to look after the people that need looking after - the hours are not relevant</li>
      
      </ul>

    <li><h4>Would a wearable device that monitors health be invasive? Why/ why not</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>If the patient pegs it you've got trouble</li>
      <li>If you stuck it up someone's arse then they have something to worry about</li>
      <li>Body orephis insertable for a bad impact on daily life</li>
      
      </ul> 
 
    <li><h4>What's your opinion on your health data being sent to the NHS?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>The nhs shouldn't hold all your data in a mass database - it should be private. </li>
      <li>One week trial only for the wearable device because I don't want those cunts knowing too much about me </li>
      
       </ul>

    <li><h4>What is your overall opinion on the NHS? Why is this?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Woah… a great inception but beyond its sell-by-date, because it is not efficient.</li>
      <li>I'm really proud to be part of the biggest gynaecological cancer centre in the uk </li>
      </ul> 
      </ol>
